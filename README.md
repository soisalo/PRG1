Data Structures and Algorithms Project PRG1
This repository contains a school project for a course titled "Data Structures and Algorithms". The primary language used is C++, and it includes a GUI.

Project Description
The project implements various data structures and algorithms. The main file, datastructures.cc, contains the following key functions:

get_bite_count: Returns the number of bites.
clear_all: Clears all stored data.
all_bites: Retrieves a list of all bite IDs.
add_bite: Adds a new bite with a given ID, name, and coordinates.
get_bite_name: Gets the name of a bite by its ID.
get_bite_coord: Gets the coordinates of a bite by its ID.
get_bites_alphabetically: Retrieves a list of bite IDs sorted alphabetically by name.
get_bites_distance_increasing: Retrieves a list of bite IDs sorted by increasing distance from the origin.
GUI
The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the data structures. Details on how to use the GUI will be provided later.

Requirements
C++ compiler
Qt framework (for the GUI)
How to Compile and Run
Clone the repository:

sh
